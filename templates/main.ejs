            <section id="about">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm currently a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics 
                    at the University of Maryland, graduating in May 2023! 
                    Last summer and fall, I had the opportunity to work as a product management intern at EqualLevel, a company that provides 
                    e-procurement solutions for public sector organizations such as the Chicago Public Schools system and the City of Houston TX government.

                </p>
                <p>I'm currently looking for roles in software engineering, data science, and product management. I am especially interested in front-end development.</p>

                        I developed this page with a partner for our final CMSC335 project. The webpage allows people to post notes 
                        and drawings to a collection dedicated to our professor. Users can also view all notes written for Professor Nelson.

                        The chat room was developed initially for students who could not go to in-person coaching due to 
                        COVID-19 concerns.

                    <p>This chat room was created during the 2020 IvyHacks Hackthon. I collaborated with two teammates to create a program that 
                        can transcribe audio from the computer source. The transcription can be done in multiple languagues.
                        This program was created with the idea of helping those who are hard of hearing during online classes.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>The program was coded in Python and utilizes the pyaudio and googletrans libraries.</p>

                <p>Aminated sp<sup>3</sup> C-H bonds appear in various pharmaceuticals. There were issues with current methods of amination because of cost, 
                    sustainability, and toxicity. We tested benzophenone imine derivatives to find the relationship between their electrophilic properties and the 
                    amination yields.</p>
